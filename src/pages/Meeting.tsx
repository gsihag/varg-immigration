Each has specific requirements. What's your professional background and purpose for migrating?",
    
    "skilled": "For skilled migration from India, you'll need: 1) Skills assessment from relevant authority (like ACS for IT, Engineers Australia for engineering), 2) IELTS/PTE English test (minimum 6 each for 189, but higher scores give more points), 3) Minimum 65 points (though competitive scores are 80-90+), 4) Age under 45, 5) Occupation on skilled occupation list. Popular Indian occupations include Software Engineer, Developer Programmer, Business Analyst, Accountant, and various engineering roles. What's your occupation?",
    
    "student": "Student visas (subclass 500) are popular among Indians. You need: 1) Acceptance into CRICOS-registered course, 2) English requirement (usually IELTS 5.5-6.5 depending on course), 3) Financial capacity (around AUD 21,000+ per year living costs plus tuition), 4) Health insurance (OSHC), 5) Genuine Temporary Entrant requirement. You can work 48 hours per fortnight during studies. Many Indians use this pathway to gain Australian qualifications and later apply for skilled migration.",
    
    "partner": "Partner visas have two stages: temporary (820/309) then permanent (801/100). You need to prove genuine relationship through: 1) Financial aspects (joint bank accounts, shared expenses), 2) Household matters (living together, shared responsibilities), 3) Social context (photos, joint social activities), 4) Commitment (future plans, knowledge about each other). Processing times are currently 15-29 months. Document everything well - this is crucial for Indian applicants.",
    
    "points": "Points test breakdown: Age (25 points for 25-32 years), English (20 points for Superior English), Employment (20 points for 8+ years skilled work), Education (20 points for Doctorate), plus bonus points for: Australian study (5), Community language like Hindi/Punjabi (5), Professional Year (5), State nomination (5-15), Partner skills (10). Most Indians need 80-90+ points to receive invitation. I can help calculate your points - share your details?",
    
    "english": "English requirements for Indians: IELTS Academic - Competent (6.0 each), Proficient (7.0 each), Superior (8.0 each). PTE Academic and TOEFL are also accepted. Many Indians find PTE easier. For skilled migration, higher English scores give more points and better invitation chances. Some visa types accept lower scores with conditions. Which English test are you planning to take?",
    
    "documents": "Common documents for Indian applicants: 1) Passport, birth certificate, 2) Educational transcripts from Indian universities (often need verification), 3) Work experience letters with detailed roles/responsibilities, 4) Skills assessment, 5) English test results, 6) Health examinations, 7) Police clearances from India and any other country lived in 12+ months, 8) Financial documents. Many documents need certified translations if not in English.",
    
    "cost": "Visa costs for Indians: Skilled Independent (189) - AUD 4,640, Student visa - AUD 710, Partner visa - AUD 8,515, plus health exams (AUD 300-500), police checks (varies), skills assessment (AUD 500-1000+), English tests (AUD 300-400). Don't forget living costs while waiting for visa processing. Always check current fees on Department of Home Affairs website.",
    
    "time": "Current processing times: Student visas - 4-6 weeks, Skilled migration - 6-18 months (varies by occupation and invitation rounds), Partner visas - 15-29 months, Work visas - 2-4 months. These change frequently. Indians should apply early and ensure all documents are ready. Processing can be faster with complete, accurate applications.",
    
    "state": "State nomination programs popular with Indians: NSW (especially Sydney), Victoria (Melbourne), Queensland (Brisbane), South Australia (Adelaide - offers extra points and lower cost of living). Each state has their own occupation lists and requirements. SA and Tasmania often have more opportunities for Indians with lower points. Which state interests you most?"
